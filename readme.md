#### **\*Maths Car Game**

I am working on a python project to provide my client, "Flow Computing" a game that teaches kids a range of maths skills. I made a maths car game built using Python, Pygame and Tkinter. The player drives a car and answers the maths questions by driving into obstacle cars with answers. The game includes a leaderboard, mistake tracker and a difficulty system with five tiers (Beginner to Advanced).





#### **\*Installations**

**Before running the game, install the required Python libraries:**



    pip install pygame

    pip install numpy



Note: Tkinter does not need to be manually installed as it comes pre installed with standard Python distributions.







**Make sure ALL files are in the program folder:**
